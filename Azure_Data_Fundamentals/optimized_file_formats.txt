1. Avro : Avro is a row-based format. It was created by Apache. Each record contains a header that describes the structure of the 
          data in the record. This header is stored as JSON. The data is stored as binary information. 
          An application uses the information in the header to parse the binary data and extract the fields it contains. 
          Avro is a good format for compressing data and minimizing storage and network bandwidth requirements.
2. ORC : ORC (Optimized Row Columnar format) organizes data into columns rather than rows. 
         It was developed by HortonWorks for optimizing read and write operations in Apache Hive 
         (Hive is a data warehouse system that supports fast data summarization and querying over large datasets). 
         An ORC file contains stripes of data. Each stripe holds the data for a column or set of columns. 
         A stripe contains an index into the rows in the stripe, the data for each row, 
         and a footer that holds statistical information (count, sum, max, min, and so on) for each column.
3. Paraquet : Parquet is another columnar data format. It was created by Cloudera and Twitter. 
              A Parquet file contains row groups. Data for each column is stored together in the same row group. 
              Each row group contains one or more chunks of data. 
              A Parquet file includes metadata that describes the set of rows found in each chunk. 
              An application can use this metadata to quickly locate the correct chunk for a given set of rows, 
              and retrieve the data in the specified columns for these rows. 
              Parquet specializes in storing and processing nested data types efficiently. 
              It supports very efficient compression and encoding schemes.
